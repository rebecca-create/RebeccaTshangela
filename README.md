# About me 
My name is Rebecca Tshangela. I am fresh Bsc Agriculture graduate from Stellenbosch University. I completed my degree in 2019 with the hopes of getting into farming but in my final year I started to develop other interests. I was born and bred in Cape Town, never lived outside of Cape Town. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. I enjoy challenging myself and putting myself in a bit of discomfort. There are many things I like doing, seeing and experiencing (mostly outdoor). Currently I am a GAP 2020 Intern at Dimension Data.
